    2.  Open the
        [Business Messages API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/businessmessages.googleapis.com)
        in the API Library.

    3.  Click **Enable**.

    4.  [Register your project](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register)
        with Business Messages.

    5.  Create a service account.

        1.   Navigate to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

        2.   Click **Create service account**.

        guide and follow the instructions to create a Business Messages agent.

        Where PROJECT_ID is the project ID for the project you created when you registered for
        Business Messages

        gcloud app deploy

    3.  On your mobile device, use the test business URL associated with the
        Business Messages agent you created. Open a conversation with your agent
